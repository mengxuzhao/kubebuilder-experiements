<h1>ðŸ§± Kubebuilder Experiments</h1>

This repo contains my hands-on experiments with Kubebuilder for implementing Kubernetes Operators. Itâ€™s part of my ongoing learning in extending Kubernetes through controllers and CRDs, with a focus on practical, real-world scenarios.

<h2>ðŸ“˜ Overview</h2>

Iâ€™ve been exploring:
- How to design and implement custom controllers and CRDs using Kubebuilder
- Running and testing controllers locally with Kind
- Integrating with GitOps workflows using ArgoCD
- Experimenting with reconciliation logic and Kubernetes API patterns

<h2>ðŸ“„ Documentation</h2>

For a detailed overview, design notes, and implementation guide, refer to the exported Confluence documentation:
